# Photo Management System

## Overview
This project implements a simple Photo Management System using the Java Collections Framework. It allows users to upload photos with metadata (date, location as latitude/longitude), add tags to photos, and search for photos efficiently by tags, date, or location.

## Features

- Upload a photo with date and location (latitude/longitude).
- Add one or more tags to a photo.
- Search by single tag.
- Search by multiple tags (AND or OR logic).
- Search by exact date.
- Search by location coordinates with radius (in km).
- Search by location name (e.g., "Cairo") with radius, checking if photos are within the zone.
