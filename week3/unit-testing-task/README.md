# Java Unit Testing & TDD Task

## Overview
This project demonstrates different approaches for **unit testing in Java**, including:

1. **Standard Unit Testing** – using JUnit without mocks.
2. **Unit Testing with Mockito** – mocking dependencies to isolate units under test.
3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – writing tests first, then implementing the functionality.

The goal is to show how testing ensures **correctness**, **reliability**, and **maintainability** of code.
